### **Problem Statement**
Indonesia has a large population and there are various types of tourism. However, Indonesia is one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the tourism sector. Then, by 2021, the number of unemployed in Indonesia reached 8.75 million. It is a challenge for the government to be able to restore and develop the tourism sector in Indonesia.

In 2021, there were approximately 14.3 million workers in the tourism sector. This number increased by approximately 340,000 when compared to 2020. The government aims to employ 4.4 million people in this sector by 2024. To achieve this target, the government has initiated a program called 'Kita Mulai Sekarang' to develop and promote sustainable tourism.

This project will analyze the potential region for the development of the tourism sector. In the analysis, the cluster used K-Means to identify potential region for development in the tourism sector. The project is expected to help in decision-making related to the potential region for development in the tourism sector in Indonesia.

### **Audience / Target User Group**
In an effort to realize this vision, one of the main focuses is to cluster the regions identified as having great potential in the development of the tourism industry. Through a rigorous approach and in-depth analysis, the main objective is to come up with effective strategies to maximize the tourism potential in each of these areas. Tourism development is not only about increasing tourist attractions, but also has the potential to have a positive impact on the regional economy. Through job creation in the tourism sector, the hope is to help reduce unemployment rates and promote sustainable economic growth. The commitment in carrying out this task is with integrity and professionalism, working together with the local government and various related parties to achieve results that benefit the community as well as the sustainable development of tourism in the region.

### **Background Information**
Indonesia is a country that possesses a wide variety of natural wealth, including clothing, food, tourism, and more. Considering its extraordinary natural resources, captivating cultural and historical richness, and the development of infrastructure that facilitates accessibility, the tourism sector undoubtedly holds potential that must be harnessed to boost the Indonesian economy. According to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), the tourism sector plays a crucial role. Based on data from 2016 to 2019, the tourism sector contributed nearly 5% to the GDP. However, due to the impact of Covid-19 in 2020, the contribution of the tourism sector plummeted to 2.24%. This, of course, had a significant impact on Indonesia's overall economy.  

In 2022, the number of foreign tourists arriving in Indonesia, especially through air travel, was dominated by Ngurah Rai Airport in Bali, with a total of 2.15 million visits (39.37 percent), followed by Soekarno-Hatta Airport with 934,660 visits (17.08 percent), and Kualanamu Airport in North Sumatra with 74,500 visits (1.36 percent). Based on this data, it is evident that the number of visits to Bali is significantly higher compared to other provinces. However, when examining the data on unemployment by province in Indonesia, Bali is not among the top 10 provinces with the highest unemployment rates. This means that there is a need to enhance the utilization of the tourism sector's potential in other provinces to reduce unemployment. Increasing the utilization of the tourism sector can lead to higher job creation, especially in the tourism trade and culinary sectors.

Currently, the government has set a target to create 4.4 million new jobs in the tourism sector by 2024. Because the absorption of labor in the tourism sector has a significant impact on increasing the income of the community and expanding job opportunities. Therefore, in this Capstone Project, we will use the K-Means method to analyze the potential development of the tourism sector based on the target employment absorption in Indonesia.

### **Project Goals**
This project's main objective is to give the government/tourism manager the data it needs to update the management plan for tourism.  The project will continue internally for the time being and be used to guide future stakeholder and public scoping.  The following goals will help to accomplish this goal: 
- Cluster Profile: 
Create a profile for every cluster by relevant variable.
- Dashboard:
Visualization of the cluster representation that could help users to analyze and explore the data with the cluster easily.
- Sustainability Insight: 
Provide information and insight of tourism sustainability by analyzing the data for the government or the authorized manager in the area.
